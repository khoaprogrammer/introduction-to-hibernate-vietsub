Hi this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight, and in this module we'll be learning how to do some basic mapping

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
in hibernate. So far we've been able to set up Hibernate, and our My SQL database.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But we haven't been able to put any data into our database using Hibernate, because we haven't set up classes

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
that are mapped to relational tables, which Hibernate knows about.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
In this module we'll learn about how mapping works in Hibernate, then we'll go through a simple example

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of mapping a Java class to a relational table in our My SQL instance.

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We'll also see how to load that data back from My SQL, and how we can even automatically generate tables

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:59:00,000
from our mapping files.
