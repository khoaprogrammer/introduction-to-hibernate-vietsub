00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now that we have our Java class for our users we need to create a table to store the users in, because

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
remember we actually want to store the users inside of our My SQL database.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
So I've opened My SQL workbench, I'm going to go ahead and go to my local instance, type in my password for

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
route, then inside here we have our protein tracker schema. You'll notice that we don't have any tables, but

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we can right click here, click Create Table, and you can just generate the SQL for this yourself if you want

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
to, but if find this tool to be pretty useful. So I'm going to go ahead and call this users, I'm calling

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
this users plural, that's usually the convention that I use. And then were going to add some columns, so the

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
first column we need an id, by default it give us id users I like to call mine id, since we already know

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
this is the users table. It is set as the primary key, it is set to be not null, so we can have a null

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
value there. Then we need to add the name, so we'll make the name. Instead of Varchar 45 let's go ahead

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and make this 100, that should be big enough for a name. We'll make it so this is not null as well.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And then we need to have our total, and we should probably make this an integer, and not null.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,000
But we can make a default value of 0, and then finally we need a goal, so let's go ahead and put our goal,

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
and we'll make this an integer as well. And then this should be not null, we can put the default value of

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
let's say 100 here if it's not specified. Make sure we get rid of this extra column that it created for us.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And now we have everything we need for our table, notice that this matches our data from our class, now we

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
happen to use the same names here, which is going to make our mapping easier.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I will show you how you can deal with if you have a different column name.

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It is defiantly best though if you can use the same column names, as you have in your Java class because its

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
going to make things a lot easier, and they're going to make a lot more sense, it will just be easy to figure

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,000
out what column things map to. Let's go ahead and click apply, you can see it generates this DDL for us.

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:10,000
That basically will create that table, ill click apply and now it's finished running that, and if we look

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
we have a table user, but it doesn't have any data in there if we select from there.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So now we have our table, we have our Java class, the last thing we need to do is to create our mapping file.
