00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now can be fairly tedious to need to need to create new database tables for all the Java classes you want to

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
persist using Hibernate. Especially when you're developing new features and Java classes that don't already

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
exist in your database. Hibernate has a built in feature that can be used at development time, that can

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:26,000
make your job much easier. In our Hibernate config file, we can specify an hbm2dll.auto option.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Which allow for auto generation of the ddl, ddl is just some SQL that generates schema for our database.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Like creating tables, or views, ddl stands for Data Definition Language.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
When we turn on this option, we can have Hibernate read the mapping file, and use the data in the mapping

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
file, to automatically create tables for our objects so we don't have to manually create them ourselves.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This can save a lot of time when developing, but this feature should not be used in production because there

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
is no guarantee your existing data won't be harmed, and some of the options will actually wipe it out on

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:10,000
purpose. There are four options that hbm2dll.auto can be set to, First you can set a two validate mode,

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and in this mode it won't actually make any changes to the database schema, but it will just validate that

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
the schema matches the mapping file. Update mode will not the existing tables, but will update them, or

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
add new tables when they are missing. Create will check to see if a table already exists, and drop that

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
table if it does along with any data in it. And then finally Create-Drop will work just like Create mode,

16
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
except that it will clean up after itself, and drop any tables it created when this session factory

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:59:00,000
is closed.
