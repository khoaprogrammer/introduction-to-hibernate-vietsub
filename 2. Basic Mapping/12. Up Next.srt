Well now you should have a good understanding of how mapping works in Hibernate as we learn how to map a

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
simple Java class to a relational table, and persist and instance of that class in My SQL using Hibernate.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But often data is not quite as simple as the example we saw in this module, more often real data has

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
relationships with other data. These relationships can take many forms which can all be mapped with

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hibernate. In the next module we'll dig a bit deeper into mapping and learn how to map different kinds

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
of relationships between data, and how Hibernate handles these relationships.

Thanks for joining me and take care.
