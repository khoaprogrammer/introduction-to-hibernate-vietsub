00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
When we have one to one data or one side is a value type we call it a component, but when we use entities it

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
is a one to one mapping. A one to one mapping is pretty simple, one entity mapped directly to another single

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
entity. In the most basic representation which you can see here, we have a user and the user has some

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
protein data, each user has exactly one protein data entry and the protein data relates to exactly one user.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We had modeled this before as a value type relationship using a component, but again there is no hard and

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
fast rule that says that protein data needs to be a valued type. We might even make protein data an entity

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
type just to make it easier to query since we might want to do some kind of aggregation on all the users

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
protein data. One to one mappings can also be mapped in a few different ways so let's take a look at some

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
real examples.
