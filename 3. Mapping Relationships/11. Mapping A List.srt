00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now let's see how we can map a list instead of the set, to convert our example to a list won't take much

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
effort at all, what were going to do is go into our user, and were going to change this from a set to a

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
list, and from hash set to an Array list and of course remember a set is basically going to not have an order,

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
but is going to allow at most one of a unique thing inside of it.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Whereas a list can have any number of elements in there and they can be duplicates if you want, but there

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:43,000
going to be in a specific order. So let's go ahead and do our imports.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
And then we'll need to change our getters and setters. Instead of set we'll be using list here we'll be

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
a list. And pretty much everything else will remain the same our program still makes sense to add items

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
to our list. And then we just need to update this mapping, so the only real difference here is that were

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:13,000
just going to change this from set to list, and we need to specify one other thing, remember a list is

11
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
ordered so it needs to have a column that's going to specify the order, so what were going to do is were

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
going to use this list index and inside here we can specify the column name to use to store the order.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So let's just make a column called position, and now what will happen is that on our user history table it

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
should add this position column, which will have the position or the ordering of the items in this list.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So were going to go to our main program, we'll go ahead and run this now.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Let's take a look at this output real quick, there really shouldn't be much of a difference here.

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If we look we've got Joe 250 we've got the two items that were in that list in order and then we did our

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:07,000
update and added our third item afterwards, so if we go to My SQL workbench and we refresh this tables and

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,000
then we go to user history. Let's go ahead and select from here, you can see that we now have our entries,

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:21,000
but we have position one and two so it's keeping track of the position in there, so that it will be able to

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
bring that back as an ordered list for us. And then if we look at our users table we can see that we have

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
our user. So everything is almost exactly the same, the only difference really here is that we could have

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:41,000
duplicates if we want to use a list, and we have this position or basically this index list, index column

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that we could call whatever we want.
