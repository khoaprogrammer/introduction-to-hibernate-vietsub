1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay so now the last thing we need to do is to map this, so let's go into our user

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
mapping, and what were going to do is we're going to map this as a set, we can use this set that's built into

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
the Hibernate mapping we set the name and this is going to be our field, which in our user class is called

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
history. Then inside set we can set a few different things, first of all we want to tell set what the table

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
should be, that it will use. So were going to have it use a table called user history.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Then we need to specify what the key is for that table so we're going to say key column and we're going to set

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
this equal to id, now the reason why were using id here is because we're going to have for the key for this

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
user history table be the same id as our user id. And the reason why were doing this is because remember

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
this is a value type, it doesn't exist on its own were just using this as a foreign key to the users table

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
so that were essentially mapping this user data to this user history data, it's basically going to create

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
this one too many we can have multiple user histories for a particular user and its going to create that

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
relationship. Then we just basically add our composite so were actually going to use composite element.

13
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We need to specify what the class is for user history so were going to say com.simpleprogrammer.userhistory

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and you do have to put that full qualification there. Then the properties just like we had done before, so

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:59,000
let's just say property name equals and we have entry time and let's double check that.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,000
We've got our entry time and our entry, so we're going to put entry time and the type will be equal to date,

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you can auto complete this to see the types, you can see that we have date in there.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And then the column name lets go ahead and call this entry time, so we'll just do it like this.

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
And then we need another one for the actual entry itself, I'm just going to copy this, paste this here,

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,000
we'll call this entry. The type here is going to be string this time and the column would be called entry.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We'll go ahead and Save this, double check and make sure we have everything here so we still have our protein

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
data, now we have history that's in this set the key is going to be the id column

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So let's go ahead and go back to our program and we'll run this, and we'll look at the console here, you can

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
see that we don't have any errors. Let's see what we've got for output here, it's created the new user

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:14,000
history table, we have entries it looks like that it's put in there, and then we have down here for output we

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
have Joe, we've got 250 and then you can see that there's a date followed by a message.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So we've got the set goal to 250 we've got the set name to Joe, so and then we did our update.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So if we look back at this code for our program you can see where we've basically added these history items,

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:41,000
there part of the set. When we loop through here were getting them back out so were able to store the

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:49,000
user data along with its history all in those two tables and then get that data back out and it's right here

31
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,000
for us to access off of the loaded user. Let's go ahead and open up the My SQL workbench, I'm just going to

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,000
do a refresh on this, and you can see we have a user history table. If I select from here you can see

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,000
there's three entries, with this entry time, and you can see what entries are, those three entries that we created.

34
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
And this is all for id one so if we look at our users table you can see if there's an id one, Joe his total

35
00:04:16,000 --> 00:59:00,000
is 50 his goal is 250, so this set data relates to that particular user.
