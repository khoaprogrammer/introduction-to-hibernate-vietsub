00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So we've still not covered all the kinds of mapping you can do with Hibernate, but we have covered most of the

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
common cases and the paths that are generally safe to tread. There are of course more complex mappings

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
including the ability to map inheritance hierarchies, but for the most part very complex mappings should

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
be avoided, because not only are they hard to get right and understand, but there difficult for someone else

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
to interpret who may be reading your code and trying to figure out exactly what kind of relationship your

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
trying to model. We also didn't cover mapping with annotations which are also an option using Hibernate.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
But most of the principles we've learned about mapping relationships will apply there as well.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
If you do want to learn more about mapping though you can check out the official Hibernate documentation

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
here, which goes into all the gory details of some of the more complex mapping situations.
