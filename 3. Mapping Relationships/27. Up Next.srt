Well congratulations on making it this far, mapping in Hibernate can be rather difficult even for experienced

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
developers who are already familiar with relational databases and Hibernate.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But it is critical to at least understand the basics and to be able to do many of the types of mappings

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
we covered in this module. I've seen many developers' waste hours of time debugging mapping problems without

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
any progress simply because they didn't understand how mapping relationships worked in Hibernate.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Don't worry though it takes some time to get comfortable with mapping so you may have to go back and try

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
out some mapping yourself to get some practice. Up next we'll be looking at querying in Hibernate.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Now that we can get complex data into our database we need to know how to get it out besides just using

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
get and load. Thanks for joining me and take care.
