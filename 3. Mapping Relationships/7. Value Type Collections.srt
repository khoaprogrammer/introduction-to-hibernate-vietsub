Next up the list of difficulty on mapping relationships in Hibernate is mapping valued type collections.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
In Java you might have a class that has a collection as a member, for example in our protein tracker app,

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
as you can see here we could have a user that has a collection of history objects which represents the

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
history of what has happened to that user. We could represent that history using different types of

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
collections in Java, we could use a set, a list, a map, or even a generic collection interface, which is

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
represented in Hibernate as a bag. Regardless of how we represent the data on the Java side, we will need

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
to create two tables on the relational database side to model this data.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
One for the user itself, and then another for the collection of history data.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For each type of collection we can use a special mapping to map the relationship in Hibernate.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's take a look at some of the most common collection types and how to map them.
