00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The first and most basic type of relationship for entities

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
is one to many, if you just learn how to do this type of mapping you can handle most entity mapping

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
situations, since in most cases one too many will work. With one too many relationships we are mapping one

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
entity to 0 or more other entities. You can see this example looks just like the collection example, and

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that is because on the Java side it's exactly the same. In fact on the database side it can be modeled

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
like a collection with the addition of a unique key to identify the entity on the many side.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
There are actually several different ways to model this data on the database side, but we'll look at just a

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
few. We can change our history examples so that the history items are entities instead of value types to

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
demonstrate this. We might want to do this if we decide later on that history items needed to be refereed to

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:59:00,000
from some other entity like perhaps the entity responsible for creating the history item, or associated to it.
