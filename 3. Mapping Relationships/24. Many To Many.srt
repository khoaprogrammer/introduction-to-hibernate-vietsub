00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Finally we have many to many mappings, you can probably figure out what a many to many mapping might look

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
like, but just in case here's an example. You can see here that users can be registered for any number of

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
contests, and each contest can have any number of users registered for it.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We can use the join table we learned about previously to implement this kind of mapping.
