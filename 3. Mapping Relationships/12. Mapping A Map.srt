00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now that we've seen how to map a set and a list, let's see how we can map an actual map.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So this is not going to be very difficult either, were just going to convert this over to a map and what

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
we'll do in this case is we'll make it so that were going to have basically an entry id, we'll have some

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
kind of entry identifier that will be the key for this map. So let's make a map of string, user history.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And we'll set this to a hash map here, we'll do string user history, do our import, and then we'll change

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
our getter and setters.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And this should be string, and string over here. And then we will need to change our program because with

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
a map we don't use add we use put, and we need to specify what the key is going to be.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So let's just add some fictional entry id, perhaps we have some kind of entry id that we uniquely generate

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:19,000
whenever we add a history item. Let's just say a GL123, and then we'll just add one for this other one,

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:30,000
let's say its GL124. Then here in our loop, we'll need to change this, let's go ahead and make this so that

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,000
instead of get history it's also going to get the entry set. And we'll change the type here, so we have this

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:48,000
entry set, and then we want to actually get history.getvalue and then we can get the entry time.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We'll do the same thing here, get value, and then let's go ahead and put out that key so it will say system

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:07,000
out.printline and we'll print out what the key is. We'll say key value and then we'll do history.getkey.

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:14,000
And then we just need to fix this one last reference here, to be a put, and we'll just put like GL125.

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So now we have this all set up, we just need to change our mapping.

18
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So this is actually pretty easy were just going to go into user instead of list you can probably guess that

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:34,000
we're going to use map. Now maps have a key, and then they have their values, this key here remember is the

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:42,000
key that corresponds to this id up here, it's how we're going to identify what this history item goes to.

21
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But we need to add a map key, so we can say map key, and then we specify the type which is a string, and

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:57,000
then what the column name should be, let's just call this entry identifier.

23
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Then we can get rid of this list index, and lets go ahead and fix the slash on this, so now were all set,

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:13,000
that's all we need to do to map a map. We'll go ahead and run our application, and you can see from our

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
output, we don't have any errors, and you can see that we've got our key value of 124, and here is the actual

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
value that was in there. And then we've got 123, and here's the value that was in there.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Remember a map like this is not sorted, so the order is not going to be guaranteed.

28
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If we wanted the order guaranteed we'd want a list or some kind of a sorted map.

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
And now if we look at our My SQL workbench, we'll just go ahead and do a refresh here.

30
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
If we look at our user history, you can see that we've got our id entry time, and tree and now we have this

31
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,000
entry identifier, which is basically the key for our map. And if we look at our users table we can see that

32
00:03:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we have our user in there as well.
