00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Another way we can model most of the different relationship types is by using a Join Table.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A Join Table is basically a third table that contains references to both of the tables being mapped, and has

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
rows that create the mappings between the tables. We can actually model different types of relationships

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
by putting restriction on the Join Table to make a column or combination of columns unique.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
But we'll try to stick to a simple case since Joins Tables can get quite complex.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We can also use a Join Table to include additional information about the mapping, for instance in this

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
example were mapping a user to a goal alert, which would be an alert that would be triggered when a goal

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
is met. We could use a user goal alert table to map the user to a specific goal alert, or set of goal alerts

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
and then the Join Table or sometimes called link table we could have an additional column that has the date

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:59:00,000
when the connection was added.
