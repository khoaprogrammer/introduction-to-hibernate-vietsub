1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So let's go ahead and create the one to many mapping from our user to our user history.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So in order to do this what were going to do is we're going to change things a little bit, first of all were

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:23,000
going to convert this back to a list, and then let's go ahead and change the getters and setters.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
And remember now were making this an entity this user history, so we're going to have to have an id and we'll

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
have to change a couple of things about user history. So let's go inside of user history next, and inside

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
the user history what were going to want to do is we're going to want to add an id, and were also going to

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
make this relationship go both directions. So we should be able to access the user from the user history and

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:58,000
access the user history from the user. Because in a case like this where we have two separate entities it

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
makes a lot more sense to have a backwards reference. So for example if we queried on user history, and we

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
got back some user histories, we'd want to be able to go back to the actual user without having to do

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:21,000
another query. So let's go ahead and first of all we'll create our id, so we'll do a private int id,

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and then we'll do a private user. And let's go ahead and add some getters and setters for these, and

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:41,000
at this point we won't really need this hash code or equals override anymore since we basically have an id

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and that ID is going to unique. So now we have our user history and what we'll want to do is to make it so

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
that when we add a user history to our user that we enforce this relationship.

16
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
We're going to want to set this user, so what were going to do inside here is we're going to add another

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:11,000
method. Let's add public void add history, and this is going to be the preferred way of adding something

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
to the history as opposed to either calling set history which we defiantly don't want to use, or calling

19
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,000
get history and then adding items. So here were going to take in a user history, and we'll just call this

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:34,000
history item. And then inside here we want to do two things, first of all we want to take our history item

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and we want to say set user, and we want to set it to this. So we want to make that relationship go from

22
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:46,000
history item to user, and then we want to make sure that we add to our history item list so we'll say

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,000
history.add this new history item. So this is going to make sure that we have the relationship going both

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:01,000
ways, which is really important if we want this to work correctly. A lot of people that are trying to get

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hibernate working get tripped up here and they'll only add the relationship one direction and then they'll

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
wonder why it doesn't work, so you do have to do this, it is good to create a method on one of the classes

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
that will do this for you so you don't have to do this everywhere that you try to make a relationship between

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
two entities. Now we also want to go back into our main program and we want to change this, remember we

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,000
don't want to do this get history anymore we want to call add history so that it sets up the relationship

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:44,000
properly. So were just going to basically copy this in everywhere where were doing this get history we want

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
to change this to our add history.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And it is still okay to call the get history here because we are actually using the history in that case.
