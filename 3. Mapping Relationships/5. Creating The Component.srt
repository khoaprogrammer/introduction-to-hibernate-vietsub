00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
I've got our project open and what were going to do is we're basically going to take our user class and were

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:17,000
going to make this into a composite in Java, were basically going to take out this information, the total,

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and the goal that applies to the protein part of a user. And were going to put that into another class

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
called protein data. Then what were going to do is we're going to map this Hibernate to be a component so

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that we're going to have this data be in the same table, it's going to be treated as a value type, but its

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
going to allow us to have that data in separate classes. Now in order to do this all we need to do is

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:51,000
basically start off by creating our new class, so I'm just going to do private, and were going to call this

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:00,000
protein data, and we'll make the variable name be protein data as well, and I'm going to set this equal to

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
a new instance of protein data. And we don't have a protein data class, so I'm going to go ahead and hit

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Control 1 as a shortcut in Eclipse here to do this create class. I'm just going to create this protein

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
data class, then were going to go back here in user and were basically just going to take total and goal,

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
we'll cut this, we'll paste it into here, and then we'll take the getters and setters for get total, set

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:43,000
total, get goal, and set goal, then we'll paste that there. Now we have our user class and our user class

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
is going to have a instance of protein data to hold its protein data, we do need to put some getters and

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
setters on this, so let's go ahead and create the getter and setter.

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
And now if we go back to our main program there's a few things that were going to want to do to fix this,

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:09,000
first of all were using this set goal, and get goal, now what we want to do is we want to say get protein

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
data and then call our set goal, so lets go ahead and fix that everywhere.

19
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
(typing)

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And let's fix this one, and looks like there's a missing import here, let's go ahead and fix that as well.
