Now by far the easiest way to model relationships in Hibernate is by using components.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Components in Hibernate just refer to Java composition relationships, in which some object is composed of

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
some other object that were treating as a value type. If you recall a difference between entity types and

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
value types, this means that the composed object only exists in the context of the parent object.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
In our example we'll be adding a new class called protein data to our user class.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Every user will have a reference to some protein data, but that protein data won't make much sense on its own.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So we'll treat that data as a value type, when we map this in Hibernate we'll end up with a single database

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
table in our My SQL database that will contain the user data and separate columns for the protein data.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We essentially flatten out our Java objects into a single relational table when we use components.
