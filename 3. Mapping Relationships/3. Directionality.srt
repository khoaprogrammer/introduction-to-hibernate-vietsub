00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The other important concept you should know before we get started, is that of directionality.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This concept is pretty simple; it basically just refers to which direction a relation goes from one piece

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
of data to another. Relationships can either be unidirectional or bidirectional, a unidirectional

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
relationship has a reference to one piece of data, but the piece of data reference does not have a reference

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
back to the other. Consider this example where we have a car that has a unidirectional relationship with

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
the wheel, the car has a reference to the wheel, but the wheel doesn't have a reference back to the car.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We could set up the relationship to be bidirectional instead where the car would have a reference to the

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
wheel, and the wheel would have a reference to the car. This is another important thing to take into

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
consideration when mapping data unidirectional relationships are easier, but sometimes you need to be able

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to refer to data in both directions.
