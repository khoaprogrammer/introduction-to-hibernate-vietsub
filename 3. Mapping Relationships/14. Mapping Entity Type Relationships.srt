Mapping Entity Relationships is more difficult than mapping value type relationships, because entity types

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
have to be able to exist on their own. For value type relationships were able to just embed the value type

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
data directly into the mapping of the entity type that contained it. But for entity type relationships we

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
need to create separate mappings for each entity type and then specify how those entity types are related.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Because of this added complexity it's defiantly a good idea to try and map Java classes using value type

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
relationships whenever possible, but in this next section we'll go over how to do entity type relationship

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:59:00,000
mapping for those times when you do need to.
