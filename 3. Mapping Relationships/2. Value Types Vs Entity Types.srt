00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Before we get started with relationships, it's important to understand a few basic concepts, first we need

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to understand the difference between value types and entity types.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
If you've studied DDD or Domain Driven Design, you may already be familiar with the concept, but most Java

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
developers don't really have to make a distinction between the two in every day Java code, so don't worry

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
if this is new to you. Any particular piece of data can either be expressed as a value type, or an entity

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
type. Let's look at an example to understand the difference; first we have the value type.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
An example of a value type would be a person's leg; we would normally make this piece of data a value type

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
because it doesn't make much sense to exist outside of the context of a person.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Another way to put this would be that we would never reference a person's leg by itself, we'd always get this

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,000
data from a person that is associated to it, the leg doesn't stand on its own so to speak.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Next we have entity types, person itself was an entity type in our previous example, and we could easily

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
imagine a situation where person has a phone, the person might have ownership over the phone, but the phone

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
exists itself without the person and doesn't require the context of a person to make sense

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We could give the phone its own id, and other entities could refer to it, it could exist on its own even if

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
we remove data about that person that happened to own it at the time.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So entities are basically pieces of data that stand on their own and can be referenced outside of the

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
context of another thing. Well value types are pieces of data that depend entirely on the entity that

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
references them. Value types do not exist on their own, now it is important to realize that this distinction

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
is self imposed. What I mean by this is that there are no hard and fast rules about what kind of data is

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:03,000
a value type verses which is an entity type. Instead you have to decide for your specific application and

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
your data how you want to treat the data. Do you need the data to stand on its own?

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Or does this data belong to another piece of data, which it doesn't make sense without?

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Whenever you're creating a mapping in Hibernate involving relationships it's important to make this decision.

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Because it will greatly affect how the data is mapped as we'll see in a bit.
