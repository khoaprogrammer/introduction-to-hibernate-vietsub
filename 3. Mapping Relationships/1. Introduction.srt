Hi this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight, in this module we'll be diving into the scary Hibernate world of

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
mapping relationships. In any non trivial application you're going to have relationships between different

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
pieces of data, after all if you don't have any relationships, why even use a relational database to begin

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
with? Well in Java relations between pieces of data are pretty simple and fairly limited in the ways they

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
can be expressed. Relational databases themselves allow for a much larger number of ways to express

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
relational data. And when you combine this with Hibernate you get even more ways to express relations

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
between data. Fortunately you only need to understand and use a few basic types of relations from most

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
applications, so we don't have to all be experts in mapping relationships.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
In this module I'll take you through some of the most common types of relationship mappings you're likely

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to want to do with Hibernate, and show you a few of the less common ones as well.
