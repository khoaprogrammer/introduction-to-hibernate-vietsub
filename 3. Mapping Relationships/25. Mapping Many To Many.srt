1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So in our example were actually going to make it so that our goal alert can be mapped as many to many

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
relationships, and we're just going to do a single direction a unidirectional relationship instead of a

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
bidirectional one just to keep things pretty simple. What were basically going to do is in our user, were

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
going to make this so that instead of just having a single goal alert were going to have a set of goal

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
alerts, so we're just going to do set of type goal alert, we'll call this goal alerts.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And we'll set this equal to a new hash set so that we always have at least something we don't have a null

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
here so we'll say new hash set of goal alert. We'll go ahead and do our imports and then we want to create

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
some getters and setters for this. And we'll go ahead and remove those old getters and setters from goal

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
alert. Then in our program let's go ahead and make it so we have a couple of different goal alerts, so were

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
going to say set goal alerts, and actually what we want to do is we want to get the goal alerts first.

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So let's do user.getgoalalerts.add and we'll go ahead and add a new goal alert, so we have one that says

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
congratulations and let's make another one that says you did it.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Now we'll go into our mapping file, were going to go into our user mapping.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And it's actually pretty easy to set this up we can get rid of this entire join table and we can replace this

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
with a set, just like we did before. And we'll call this name goal alerts, that's the field that were using

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
in our user class, and then we want to set the table for this, this will actually be our join table its going

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
to automatically create this we don't have to use the join syntax here.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So were going to call this user goal alert just like we had called it before. We want to set of course the

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
cascade option on this to make things easier on ourselves so we'll do save update.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Then inside here we need to specify the key, so the key will be a column called user id.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This will be one of those columns in that table that user goal alert table.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
And then were going to use this many to many in order to define the other part of the relationship.

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We'll need our class which will be com.simpleprogrammer and then we'll make it .goalalert.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then were going to say what the column for this one is and this column were going to call goalalert_id.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So that's it we should be able to run our example now, and you can see everything ran correctly without

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
any errors, we've got quite a bit of data here because it is doing quite a bit now.

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
And if we go to our SQL workbench lets go ahead and refresh this. We can look at our goal alert we can see

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
we have id one and two which there are two messages in there. And now if we look at this user goal alert

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:18,000
you can see that user id one has two goal alerts mapped to it, goal alert id one and goal alert id two.

30
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
And of course if we look at our users table we can see that we have this user id of one.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So that's a basic unidirectional many to many mapping because we can basically map different number of goal

32
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
alerts to a user, and we could also go the other way and we could reuse these goal alerts.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We could have for example in here user id two map to goal alert id one.
