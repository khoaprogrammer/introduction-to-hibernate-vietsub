00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now let's go ahead and get our Java project created. Now I'm going to be using eclipse during this

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
course, but you can use IntelliJ, or NetBeans, or whatever IDE that you would like.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The reason why I'm using eclipse is because it is free and the free version of eclipse does have a Hibernate

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
plugin, which I'm going to show you in a minute. Now you can use IntelliJ, and IntelliJ does have Hibernate

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
support, but only for the paid version. So if you do have the paid version and you do like IntelliJ you can

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,000
go ahead and do that. Most of what were going to cover is going to apply the same to IntelliJ as well as

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Eclipse of any IDE because we're not really going to be doing IDE specific things, instead were going to

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
be creating configuration files, and really the plug-ins just help us to do that.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So let's go ahead and first within Eclipse setup our Hibernate plug-ins.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So if you go to Help and then install new software, what you'll want to do is go to available software sites,

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and then you'll want to add, you can see that I've added this JBoss tools core.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So let me go ahead and edit this, and you can see this link here, http download.jboss.org/jbosstools updates

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
stable juno. And this is because I'm using thee Juno version of Eclipse.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And if you want to find this instead of copying this link, if you just search for Hibernate tools eclipse,

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
it should pretty much take you to this Hibernate tools page.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And then here you can see it has the Hibernate tools for Eclipse and Ant.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
And form here if you click on Downloads you can see that there are the update sites that are listed here.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So in our case, I'm using Eclipse 4.2.2, if you have an older version of eclipse you might want to pick one

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
of these other ones. But I would encourage you to update to the current version of Eclipse so that you can

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
follow along exactly in this course. And you can go to the Stable release, and if you click this you'll

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
notice it gives you some steps. Basically it's telling you to take this link and copy this into here.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So if you do that then what you can do is click OK, and then you'll wan to select to work with this JBoss

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
tools core, and you can see this gives you all the tools. You'll want to narrow this down to Hibernate,

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,000
so if you just do a search on Hibernate, you can see that there's Hibernate tools and JBoss Maven Hibernate

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
configurator. All we really need is to Hibernate tools, so you can check this one.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You can go ahead and install this JBoss Maven Hibernate Configurator if you want to use Maven as well.

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
And you can see they're listed under a few different categories, so there all the same thing you only really

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
need to select these two. And then just click Next, and install this.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I already have this installed, and when you have this installed you should be able to see this if you click

30
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
on already installed, and should show Hibernate tools here. And then it will ask you to restart Eclipse.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And really what this is going to do for us, is its going to give us some tooling to be able to make it

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
easier for us to use Hibernate configuration files and to create them, and it will give us a perspective

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that we can launch that will let us view things from a Hibernate perspective.
