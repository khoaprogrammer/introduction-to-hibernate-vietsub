1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This course will take you through the process of setting up Hibernate, mapping objects to relational tables,

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and querying those objects using Hibernates query language. We'll start out with the module your currently

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
watching where we'll learn a bit about what an ORM is and what Hibernate does, and get it set up with my

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
SQL as our database, as well as learn how to setup the Hibernate configuration.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Then in Module 2 we'll learn about one of the key parts of Hibernate, mapping files.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll learn the basics of creating a map and file that maps a Java class to a SQL table.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
And we'll learn how to do some basic storing and retrieving of data using our mapping files.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
In module 3 we'll continue our education about mapping and Hibernate as we learn how to model relationships

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
between objects and relational tables in our mapping files. We'll learn how to map different kinds of

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
relationships, like one to one and one to many, and get into some of the complexities of mapping files.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Then in Module 4 we'll learn all about querying using Hibernate, we'll learn the basics of using the

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hibernate query language to query objects stored in the database, and see how to use the criteria API's

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
to create complex query's. Finally in the last module we'll take a brief look at some advanced topics,

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,000
like cashing, transactions, and interceptors. We won't be going in depth into any of those subjects, but

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we'll be learning enough about them to understand the basics and when they should be used.
