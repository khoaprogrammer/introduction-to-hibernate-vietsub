1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So the next thing were going to want to do is to get Hibernate in our application, so I'm going to go ahead

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
and create a lib folder, we just go to New folder, were going to call it lib, and we'll put all our libraries

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
in here. So let's go ahead and find our Hibernate libraries, were going to get all these jar files, I'm

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
just going to Copy them right here. So now we have all those and then there is one other thing we'll need

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
which is, I'm going to go to the default place where My SQL installed the My SQL connector, basically the

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Java connector to the JDBC driver, so it's under program files x86, and then under My SQL.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
There is a connector J, this is what we're looking for, and you can see that there's this My SQL

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
connector-Java and this jar file we can basically copy into the lib folder as well.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Now just because these are in the lib folder doesn't mean there accessible, so what we have to do now is go

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
to our build path, were going to say configure build path. We're going to go to libraries, were going to

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
do this add jars, and were basically going to add everything inside of our lib folder.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Then we'll click OK, now you can see these are showing up as reference libraries.

13
00:01:25,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Now we're all set to create a Hibernates configuration to actually be able to use Hibernate.
