00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Okay so were going to go ahead and create our project now, I'm just going to do File, New Java project.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm just going to call this protein tracker, were going to be creating a console application or just a

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
command line application to track some protein and we'll be using this to demonstrate the capabilities of

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hibernate. I'm just going to click Next, and then Finish, so now we have our project.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Let's go ahead and create a class that we'll call program, this will be our main entry point for our program.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
And we've got a main here, and then let's just go ahead and run this just to make sure that everything is

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
working properly before we get started. So were just going to do a system.out.printline and were just going

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to print Hello world, and we'll run this, and you can see were getting the output of Hello world.
