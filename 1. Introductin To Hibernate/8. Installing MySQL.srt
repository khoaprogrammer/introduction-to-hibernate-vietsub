1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So were going to start off by setting up our environment, and the first thing we are going to do to setup

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
our environment is to get our relational database. In this course were going to be using My SQL as our

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
relational database, and that's because it's a fairly robust database, and it is also free, at least there is

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
a free version of it. And you can of course use whatever database that you want, you're just going to have

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
to make a few different changes in the configuration, but if you want to follow along here, you can go ahead

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
and get My SQL and you'll want to go to MySQL.COM from here you'll click products.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It can be a little bit confusing to navigate around here because of the different My SQL additions, but what

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
we want is the free community edition, so if we go to this download my SQL community server link.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then here we can find the general availability releases and you can choose whatever operating system your

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,000
using, in this case I'm using Microsoft Windows. And there is actually a My SQL installer MSI file that

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
makes it really easy to install.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So I'm just going to go ahead and download this, and you can see that it gives me two choices, either a web

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:17,000
based installer, or the full installer. I'm just going to go ahead and choose the web based one, and you

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
don't actually have to sign up here, it looks like you do, but this is just a little trick to try and get you

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
to sign up, but you can just click this No thanks just start my download link.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And when you do that it will go ahead and start this MSI, which we can run.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then you should see this Welcome screen, where we can click Install My SQL products.

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We need to Accept the license, click Next, and I'm going to go ahead and let this do a check to find the

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
latest products, which we already had the latest so there shouldn't be any problem.

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Then we'll click Next, and I'm just going to choose the developer default, if you want to if you understand

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
a little bit more about My SQL you can choose one of these other ones, either do a full or custom, but

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
developer default will work for most people. So were going to click Next, and then you'll see what the

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
requirements are, and these are the requirements based on that default developer profile.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So you'll see some things like the Visual studio in Microsoft, .NET, if you don't have these things, so

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
if you're missing some of these requirements and you do want to still install this, you can go back here and

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,000
go to custom, and then from here you can go ahead and pull out the different things that you don't want.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But you might as well just do the developer default unless you have a problem, because you're going to get

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
everything you need. So I'm going to go ahead and click Execute, and one more time on the Execute.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You can see its installing the Python connectors that it needs.

30
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So all the prerequisites are met, now I'm going to click Next, and now it's going to basically download each

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,000
one of these components and install them. And just too briefly go over some of these, we have the My SQL

32
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
server, this is our main database engine. We have this workbench, which is a very nice tool for interacting

33
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:13,000
with My SQL, it makes it easy for you to run queries, and to see the database without having to do everything

34
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
from the command line. We've got a notifier, which isn't that important, some excel connectivity, this

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:27,000
connector J, which basically has our JDBC driver and then the .NET driver as well, our documentation and

36
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
then some samples. So let's go ahead and click Execute, and you can see its going to download all this, and

37
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
install it, and I'll go ahead and let this happen and then we'll resume from here.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
So you can see everything is installed now, I'm just going to go ahead and click Next.

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And then we need to configure My SQL, the actual server part, so we're going to click Next.

40
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The config type we can choose what our config type is, in most cases were just going to want this development

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:02,000
machine. The default port is 3306, and by default it will open the firewall so that you can access this from

42
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
the network. I'm just going to leave this as a default; I'm not going to select this show advanced options.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Now we need to set a route password because all My SQL databases need to have a route user, which is

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
basically the admin user, or the user that can access everything in the database.

45
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,000
So I'm just going to set for the route password, Password. Obviously you don't want to do this if your

46
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
storing any sensitive data in your database, but I'm just going to keep things pretty simple.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You can also add a user account here, let's go ahead and add one called appuser.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:44,000
And we can put this on all hosts or local hosts, it doesn't really matter, the role were going to leave this

49
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
as DB Admin so that they'll have basically full rights to the database.

50
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Authentication will be My SQL and I'm going to make this password, Appuser.

51
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Again you probably want to use a more secure password for your database.

52
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now we're going to click Next, and then we can basically set this to run as a Windows service, and start it

53
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,000
at system startup. If you do install just remember that you have this running when you're done with My SQL,

54
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you might not want to always have this running as a service. If you don't choose to install this as a

55
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Windows service, you can always start the service yourself, or if you don't choose to start the My SQL server

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
at system startup you can go into services and start that, it's up to you.

57
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm going to go ahead and leave this as default, and also leave this as a default to Standard System Account

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
for running it. And we'll click Next, it's going to configure the product, and we'll click Next again.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And Next one more time, and then we can start the My SQL workbench right afterwards, and you can see that

60
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,000
this brings up this My SQL workbench which has a lot of different tools in here for administrating your

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
server, for doing some data modeling, and for doing SQL development.

62
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
This is probably the most common thing that you'll use, which if we just double click this we are asked for

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
our route password, and if we enter that then it takes us into a window here where we can see a couple of

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
databases, that are already populated with some data, and we can go ahead and run queries against these.

65
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:32,000
For example I could do a Select star from city, and run this and I'm getting all of the data form that

66
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
particular database. So this is a pretty useful tool if you want to use My SQL.

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
We're not going to get to much into this as were going to be mostly interested in just using My SQL for

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Hibernate, but now you should have My SQL installed and we are ready to get started with a Java project and

69
00:06:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
actually get Hibernate.
