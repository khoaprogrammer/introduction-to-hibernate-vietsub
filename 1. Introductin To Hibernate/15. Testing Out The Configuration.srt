1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now were actually ready to test out our setup, we can't actually store any data yet, because we still have

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
to credit mapping. So there's still even more configuration, but we can at least test this out to make sure

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that were able to hit the database and everything is working. So before we do that I'm going to go into our

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Hibernate config, and for the session factory the tools are a little bit older than the newer version of

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Hibernate, so right now there generating a couple of things that are a little bit dated.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
First of all it's adding this name equals, when you don't specify a name for a session factory, and this

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
can cause an error. And second of all in the dtd's it actually specifies Hibernate.sourceforge.net

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You'll see a warning that comes up because this has changed, but we can leave that, that one's not a big deal.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We do have to change this so, because you will have a problem if you don't.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
So what were basically going to do is we're just going to try to create a session, open a new session, and

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
close it. And if we can do that, then we can be pretty sure that we configured everything correctly and were

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
able to access our database. So what were going to do is do Hibernate utilities.getsesionfactory and then

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
we're just going to say Open Session. That will give us a new session, we'll store this in a variable called

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:20,000
session. We'll need to import session, and then were just going to say session.close and that's pretty much

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it. So let's go ahead and run this, and we can look at the output here, let's go ahead and make this big.

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
So we got Hello world, and then if you look through here most of these are info, so we can see some of the

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
things that loaded up. Anything that's info we don't really have to worry about, we do have a warn here,

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and remember this is that obsolete name space, so it tell us that we should be using Hibernate.org.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You can change that if you want to, but it's not really important, and then we can see that session factor

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
was configured, some additional information here, everything looks right saying what driver it's using,

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
it's connecting to local hosts, and it's using this connection property for our app user, and our password,

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
set up our dialect, everything looks like it's working properly. So all signs point to that we have

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
everything configured correctly, and working. Now if you see an exception here, or some errors, you may

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
have something configured incorrectly you might have to go back through and make sure you have everything

25
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:31,000
exact. I know this is fairly tedious, but I promise you that once you have everything working and

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
configured, you won't have to go through this again, at least for a simple project.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So it's important to get the setup the right way the first time, take your time, don't worry that this is

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
taking a long time at first. It's a little bit intimidating, but once you get the setup then things will

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
be much faster and once easier inside of Hibernate.
