Hibernate is just and open source ORM that is able to map Java objects to a variety of different relational

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
databases. Hibernate is a framework that allows us to specify the configuration to use, to connect with our

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
database, and to specify the way which our Java object should be mapped to relational tables.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And it does a job of creating SQL that is able to Save, Update, Delete, and query data from the database.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It presents this data to us as Java objects that we can use and manipulate then save back to the database.

00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hibernate has a pretty long history as it was originally created in 2001 by Gavin King and was originally

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
designed to be a better alternative to the current persistence in Java offered by EJB2 style entity beans.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Don't worry if you don't know what those are you probably don't want to know.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Those were painful times indeed. And Hibernate is still under development as at the time of the recording of

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:06,000
this course, Hibernate 5.0 is being developed with a goal of having JPA 2.1 support, which we'll talk about

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:59:00,000
next.
