Hi this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight and welcome to this course on Hibernate.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hibernate is one of the most well-known object relational mappers or ORM's in the Java world and shaped

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:21,000
much of the way other ORM's were built in both Java and other environments, but Hibernate can be a bit

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
tricky to get started with. Unfortunately there isn't a quick way to just get going with Hibernate,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
because Hibernate although powerful is a fairly complex framework.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
This course aims at making it as easy as possible to understand enough of the basics of Hibernate to get

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
started with it. In this course I'll take you through the process of getting Hibernate set up, which can

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
be one of the most difficult parts of working with Hibernate, and I'll show you everything you need to know

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
to be able to map your Java classes to SQL tables, and use Hibernates powerful query language to query

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
your database. By the end of this course you should be able to set up Hibernate to work with a Java

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:59:00,000
application and know how to use the basic features of Hibernate as well as some of the advanced ones.
