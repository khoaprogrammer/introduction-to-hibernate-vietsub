00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
This course is designed for developers that want to learn the basics of Hibernate, to be able to use it for

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
persisting Java objects in a SQL database. So in order to get the most out of this course you'll need to at

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
least be somewhat familiar with Java, you don't have to be an expert, but you will need to know the basics

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
in order to understand hibernate since we'll be writing Java code to use Hibernate.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
It will also help greatly if you have some knowledge of SQL in relational databases since Hibernate maps

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Java objects to relational database tables. It is possible to use Hibernate without understanding much

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
about relational databases, but if you ever need to troubleshoot a Hibernate query, which is more of a when

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:51,000
then and if, you'll definitely want to understand how the SQL that Hibernate is generating works.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So if your uncomfortable with SQL I'd recommend you take one of the SQL courses first and then come back

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
here. In this course we'll be sticking mostly to the basics, but we'll also cover some of the advanced

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
features in the last module, so even if you already know something about Hibernate you'll probably find this

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
course to be useful for filling in gaps in your knowledge. If you're already an expert in Hibernate though

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
you'll probably find this course to be pretty boring.
