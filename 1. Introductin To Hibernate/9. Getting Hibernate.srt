1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now the next thing that we need is Hibernate, were just going to download Hibernate for now, and then when we

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
create our Java project were going to add the Hibernate jars to it.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
So what you could to is just go to www.hibernate.org, then go to downloads, and then from here there's

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
actually a few different options that you have. You can see that at the time of recording this course the

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
current final released version of Hibernate is 4.2.3. And just to let you know the documentation for

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Hibernate really is still a little bit dated, at least at the time of recording this course, so some of the

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
new 4.0 type of things are not in the documentation it's still really treats it as if it were Hibernate 3.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So if you are looking at the documentation and you do get confused just be aware that it may not be fully

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
up to date. Now the way that were going to use Hibernate is were actually going to download this

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Final.ZIPP, I'm going to go ahead and start this download, and I'm just going to go ahead and click this

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
direct link. And it's a pretty big download, 64.5 megabytes, and that's because it contains all the source

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
code and everything. And the reason why were going to do it this way is because this will simplify things a

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
little bit, were just going to basically get the jars out of the lib folder here.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
You could of course use Maven if you're familiar with Maven, if we go back to that page here you can see

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
that it has some information about the Maven repository artifacts.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Or you can use Ivy or something like that, if you're familiar with that.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But we're going to keep things simple and basically just copy the jars into our project once we've downloaded

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Hibernate. Alright so now that we've got the Hibernate file downloaded, let's go ahead and take a look

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
what's in here, so you can see that we have this Hibernate release 4.2.3 final.

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And we actually have everything in here if you wanted to actually build Hibernate yourself, which is sort of

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
nice because if you had some problem and you need to debug it you do have the source code.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But we won't be doing any of that in this course, instead were going to be interested in this lib folder.

23
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
And what were going to look at is this required, into here is everything that were going to need.

24
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:19,000
So what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to copy this over on my machine I have the utilities directory,

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:27,000
under here I have libraries, and I'm just going to put Hibernate in here and then paste all of these jars

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:35,000
over. And we'll come back to this when we actually set up our project we'll be adding all these jars to

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:42,000
our project. So now that we have Hibernate, we can go ahead and create our Java project, we can use these

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
jars so we can get Hibernate configured to communicate with My SQL.

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:59:00,000
And the only other missing piece is we'll need to have the JDBC driver from My SQL.
