Often times you'll need to make changes to a large number of entities,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
with Hibernate, or to insert a large number of entities into your database.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Anytime you're dealing with a large number of entities you should think about how best to handle batching

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
processing of those entities.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Remember that Hibernate is automatically using a first level cache

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
so we have to be careful about doing too many operation in a single session

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
otherwise we could fill up the memory being used by the first level cache.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We have two basic choices for batch processing with Hibernate.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
First, we can use HQL queries to actually perform insert, updates, or deletes.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This allows us to change data without having to pull down local instances of all the objects we want to change.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Second, we can periodically flush data from the first level cache to conserve memory.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:59:00,000
I'll show you how to do both of these techniques next.
