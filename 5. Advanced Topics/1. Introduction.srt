Hi this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight, and welcome to this last module in the Introduction to Hibernate course.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
In this module, we'll be taking a look at some advanced functionality of Hibernate.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We'll be learning about Hibernate features we haven't covered so far

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
like caching, batch processing, and using interceptors and filters.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
We won't be diving too deeply into these topic because this is still and introductory course

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but I do think it is important to have at least some knowledge of these topics

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
even when you're first starting out so that you can know what kinds of features exist

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
that can solve some pretty difficult problems you may face.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You can always fill in any knowledge in this area later on once you know a little bit about it.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
At the end of this module I'll also be recommending an excellent book

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
which contains more detailed information about Hibernate and expounds upon many of the topics

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:59:00,000
we'll be covering in this chapter, in depth.
