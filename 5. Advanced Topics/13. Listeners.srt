00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now Hibernate also has support for listeners which allow you to listen to a specific event that occurs

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
and respond to it.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The listeners can be use either in addition to interceptors or as a replacement for them.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A listener can created that implements the interface for the specific event it wants to respond to.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, a load event that would fire when an entity is loaded.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The listener can then get information about the event and respond to that event by executing some custom code.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
One classic example of where this can be useful is implementing custom security.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You can set up event listeners to listen for various events and then to authorization checks

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to make sure the user triggering the event has the correct permissions.
