00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Well, we've finally made it to the end of this course.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
We've covered quite a bit of ground in this course and hopefully by now you have a pretty good understanding

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
of what Hibernate is about and how to use it.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
We've covered most of the important basic concepts that you'll need to know to maintain an existing

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Hibernate application and to even build a new application using Hibernate.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But there's more to Hibernate than what we've covered in this introductory level course.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I usually don't recommend books in my Pluralsight courses,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but I think the 'Java Persistence with Hibernate' book is such a good book that it's worth recommending.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
This book covers just about every aspect of Hibernate in detail and it's a great resource for

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
expanding your knowledge further.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
In fact, it's almost 1000 pages so it has a lot of information that we wouldn't be able to cover

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
even in a very long Hibernate video course.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
So if you're interested in learning more about some of the advanced features

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
of the topics that we covered in this module, this is a great resource.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Do be aware though that some of the Hibernate 4 specific things, specifically around the listeners,

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
are going to be a little bit different because that has changed in Hibernate 4.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The basics we covered in this course should take you pretty far but you may get to the point

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
where you really need to dig deep to optimize your queries and troubleshoot difficult problems;

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and when you do I'd recommend you take a look at this book.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, thanks for joining me on this tour through Hibernate and I wish you well with all your

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
object relation mapping. Take care.
