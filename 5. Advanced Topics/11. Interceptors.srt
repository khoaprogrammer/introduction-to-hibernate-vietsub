When using Hibernate you may find the need for doing something whenever a save, update,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
or other operation happens on an entity in Hibernate.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hibernate allows you to create interceptors that are basically able to intercept entity operations

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
like save or update.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
And then allow you to execute some code before the operation completes.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
One of the most used examples of this is for auditing.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You can use the interceptor capabilities of Hibernate to intercept saves or updates to a particular entity type

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
and save an audit record to record that change of data.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Interceptors, of course, can be used for other purposes as well.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's take a look at an example.
