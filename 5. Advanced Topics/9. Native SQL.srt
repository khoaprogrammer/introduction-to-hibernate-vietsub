For the most part you can use HQL and the criteria API to perform your queries in Hibernate.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
But sometimes, especially when working with Legacy databases, that weren't really design with Hibernate in mind,

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
it's important to be able to execute some raw SQL.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Fortunately, this is pretty easy to do in Hibernate.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And Hibernate will even help you by mapping the result set, returned to a java object for you.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
You just have to give it a little bit of information to know what entity types are being returned.
