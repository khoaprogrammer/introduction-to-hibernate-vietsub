00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Another common problem in many applications using Hibernate is needing to filter data.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
For example, I may have certain data that should only be displayed to a user that has a certain role

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
or security clearance level.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It can be difficult to add this kind of filtering manually to all of the queries

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
being used to fetch data in Hibernate and is easy to accidently miss one creating a potential security hole.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hibernate has support for data filters.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Which can defined and attached to a session so that all queries in that session pass through these filters

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
which filters the data.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Using data filters it is possible to set up filtering logic in a single location

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and have that logic applied to all queries executing in a session.
