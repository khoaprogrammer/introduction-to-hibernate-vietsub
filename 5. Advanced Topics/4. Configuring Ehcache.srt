1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So now that we have the latest version of Ehcache, we're going to want to configure this for Hibernate.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
And there's a couple things that we're going to want to do.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We're going to need to add a couple of properties to this hibernate.config file.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And then we also need a certain .jar that we're still missing.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
So if you go back to where you downloaded this Hibernate release, you're original zip file.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Remember inside here we had gone to this lib directory and we went to required and we got all these .jars.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Well inside here threes also this optional,

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and here you can see Ehcache and this actually has all of the Ehcache .jars that you need.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Now I went ahead and showed you how to get Ehcahce from the website

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
because I want you to know how to get the latest version.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And also so you could have access to that documentation because that's going to be helpful

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
if you have any trouble with Ehcache.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
But you could grab all the .jars here.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The one that we do need, that we're missing though, is this hibernate-ehcache.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So I'm just going to go ahead and copy that directly into our lib folder.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll need to extract this out of here first, so I'm just going to paste this

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and then I'm going to move this over.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And we can just drop this into our lib folder.

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
So now we've got our hibernate-ehcache, we'll need to add that to our build path.

20
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
So let's go into here and we're just going to go to libraries,

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Add JARs and we should find this ehcache.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So now we're set up and we just need to add a couple of properties.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
So we're just going to do property, and the first thing we want is hibernate,

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and we're looking for cache, and we want region.factory_class.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And I'm just going to use this value that you can find in that Ehcache documentation.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And this value is for Hibernate 4 and greater.

27
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
If you're using an earlier version it will be slightly different, this class name.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But for this version it's org.hibernate.cahe.ehcahce.EhCacheRegionFactory.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
The older version what net.sf.ehcache.hibernate and then EhCacheRegionFactory.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Then the other property that we need to do is this property to turn on the caching

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,000
because by default the second level cache is disabled so we're going to say second_level_cache equals true.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now we could also set a third property to turn on query caching but we're not going to be covering

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,000
query caching in this module but in addition to caching entities we can also cache queries.

34
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay, so we don't have any caching set up at this point yet but let's go ahead and test this out

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
just to make sure that our properties are configured correctly, that we've got all out .jars,

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
because there are quite a few things that could go wrong.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So I'm just going to run our project.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And we should see it run, just like before, with no problems.

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
As long as you're getting this output then you're okay.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
If you get an error just make sure you have all the .jars that you need,

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,000
make sure that these properties are exactly correct because this can be a little bit difficult to troubleshoot.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Most likely you would see an error saying that it couldn't load some class,

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:59:00,000
which is probably going to indicate that you're missing a .jar.
