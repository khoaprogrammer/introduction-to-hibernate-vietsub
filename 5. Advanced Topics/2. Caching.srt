00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
One of the first optimizations that you may want to do with an application using Hibernate is caching.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Caching itself is not difficult to implement in Hibernate

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
but using it properly can be a bit of a challenge.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
In this section I'm going to show you the very basics of setting up caching in Hibernate

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
but we won't be going into much of the details of when you should use it

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and how best to make use of caching.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
First, it's important to understand how caching works in Hibernate.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
There are actually two layers of caching.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The first level cache we are already using.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
When we work with a session on Hibernate, we don't immediately send SQL statements to the database

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
after each operation.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Instead the objects we are creating and changing are cached in the first level cache

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
and all of the changes to the database are persisted at once,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
unless we've flushed them earlier.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This first level cache works automatically and saves us round-trips to the database.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
But it is important to understand that this first level cache does consume memory.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We'll talk more about this concern when we discuss batch processing.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Next, we have the second level cache.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This level of caching is actually optional and is not turned on by default.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
In fact, to use this caching we need to configure it in Hibernate

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and use a cache provider to provide and implementation for caching.

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The second level cache can be configured to operate at several different levels

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
but the easiest way to think about it is that it is a cache that exists outside of a single session.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Let's take a look at a very simple example of setting up a basic second level cache.
