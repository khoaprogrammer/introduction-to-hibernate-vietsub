1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now with second level caching in Hibernate, we have to choose a cache implementation,

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
we don't have one that's automatically included with Hibernate, itself.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
We actually have to set up an implementation.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,000
One of the simplest implementations to set up is this Ehcahce.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
And if you go to ehcache.org, you can find the download for this and some set up instructions.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We're basically going to be following the set up instructions in here

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
and we're going to be downloading the latest version on Ehcache.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In order to vet this all we have to do is go to this Documentation.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And then from here, if you go to Hibernate 2nd Level Cache,

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you can see there's a Hibernate Table of Contents,

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
and if you click Hibernate Second-Level Cache,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
this has all the instructions and it tells you where you can download the latest version.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
What we're going to do to start is just get the latest version of Ehcache.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
And you can see that right now there's a 2.6.5.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
So I'm going to go ahead and select that version.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I'm going to go ahead and download this.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And then within here you'll see that there is a .tar,

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and we can open with up and then we have the ehcache-core,

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
inside here what we're really interested in is this lib folder.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
This has everything that we're going to need.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So what we're going to do is we're going to copy this over to another temporary location.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm just going to go ahead and put this in utilities,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,000
and I'm just going to make under libraries and ehcache,

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and here I'll go ahead and put those .jars.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay, so now that we have these .jars, what we're going to do is we're going to go over to our project

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and we're just going to put this in the lib folder.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We'll need all of these.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
So we can just copy them into here.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And then we need to set up our build path.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We're just going to Configure Build Path.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We're going to say add .jars.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And we're going to lib and we're going to select all of these .jars.

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So now we're set up to use Ehcache but we still have to configure caching in Hibernate.
