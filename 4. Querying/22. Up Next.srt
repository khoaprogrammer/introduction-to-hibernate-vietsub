00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Alright, well at this point we've covered most of the basics of Hibernate.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
You should now be able to get Hibernate set up, create mappings for your java objects,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
relate them to each other, and now also query them from your database

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
using wither HQL or the criteria API.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But there is still more to learn about Hibernate.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
And although we don't have time to go through everything else there is about Hibernate in this beginner's course,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
we'll briefly cover some of the advanced topics in the next module.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
So you'll know what you don't know and see which advanced areas of Hibernate you'll want to learn more about.

00:00:35,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Thanks for joining me and take care.
