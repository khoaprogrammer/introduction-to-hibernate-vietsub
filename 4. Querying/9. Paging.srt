00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Now one thing that we can do very easily with HQL is to implement paging.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This is a very common problem needing to be able to page data or get just a subset of some data

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
that you can page through like pages in your application.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
For example, if you have a web application and maybe you have a little arrow

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
and you're showing ten results at a time, this is sometimes a difficult problem to solve.

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
But we can do this pretty easily in Hibernate, so let's go ahead, and change this

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
so we're going to get rid of our where clause.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We're just going to select all the users, in fact, let's go ahead and change this so that we just get the alerts.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Because these alerts, if we look at our alerts, there are more of them in here,

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
so it will make more sense to page on this.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So let's say 'from GoalAlert' and we currently have four GoalAlerts in here.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And what we're going to do is we're going to say set '.FirstResult'

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So we can say let's start at result number two and then we can also set the max result.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So we could say '.setMaxResults', and we could set this to one.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
So we could basically go one at a time if we wanted to.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So let's go ahead and try this out. We'll just change this here from user to GoalAlert.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
And we'll change this to alerts,

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
and then alert and GoalAlert.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
And then we'll just print out here what that message is.

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
So we'll do 'alert.getMessage'.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's go ahead and run this, and now you can see that we got this one message of 'Taco time!'

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Which was, basically, the second result in our result set but we only got one back.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If we were to take these off and just run this,

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
you'll see that we get back the full set, we won't be paging this at all.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
So we get back everything: You made it! Good job! Taco time! Yes!!

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
And so we can use this to basically do paging.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So you can imagine you can pass a variable into here and you could set the first result

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
to be whatever you wanted and this could be your page size.

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Maybe you're returning ten results at a time and you're on page zero, page one, page two, and so forth.
