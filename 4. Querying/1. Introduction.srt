Hi this is John Sonmez from Pluralsight and welcome to this module on querying and Hibernate.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So far we've learned how to map data and to use those mappings to put data into our database using Hibernate.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
But what good is getting data into a database if we can't get it out?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Just like we can use SQL to query a relational database directly,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
we can use Hibernate to query the database in terms of the java objects we've mapped.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
In this module, we'll go through the basic features of the Hibernate querying API's

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and learn how to create queries for getting back data from our my SQL database.

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Just like we could using SQL natively.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We'll also learn how to use the eclipse Hibernate tools to enable us to test our queries in an editor

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
to quickly get feedback and check results.
