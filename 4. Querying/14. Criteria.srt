00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The criteria API offers us another way to query Hibernate data with a more object oriented approach.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Using the criteria API we construct a set of criteria for a query using restrictions and projections

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
which are used to generate SQL to perform the query.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The criteria API can be a bit verbose when constructing complex queries

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
but since the queries are built up by adding criteria

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
it lends itself better to programmatically creating dynamic queries

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
that might vary by more than just parameters.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:59:00,000
We can also use the query by example approach using the criteria API to create criteria from an existing object.
