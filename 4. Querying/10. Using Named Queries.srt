00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Now one common thing that you might want to do is to take all of these queries out of your code.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
It can be a little bit messy to have HQL inside of your code.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You might want to have this in a separate place where you have all your queries

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
and then you can just call your queries by name.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
This can be done pretty easily in Hibernate.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
For example, we can take our from GoalAlert and we'll just take this out,

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
we'll put this into our GoalAlert configuration.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So under hibernate-mapping we can add query.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We can give this query a name. Let's see, AllGoalAlerts.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
And then we can actually put our query in here.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And usually we want to put this in a CDATA tag

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
just to make sure that it doesn't get parsed by the XML parser and get interpreted as XML data.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So we can do that by just adding CDATA, and then we'll put our query in here,

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and then close this tag.

15
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So now we have our query. It's a named query called AllGoalAlert.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
And we can use this from inside of our code by calling on session get name query.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So we can say session.getNamedQuery' and we can specify what our query name is

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
which was AllGoalAlerts, so let's go ahead and put that in here.

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
And you can see that this actually returns us back a query

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
so we can actually use this in place of our query.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And now we're getting all goal alerts.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
So we can go ahead and run this and we should see all of them show up.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And now we can look at our results and you can see we've got everything coming back:

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:59:00,000
Good job! You made it! Taco time! and Yes!!
