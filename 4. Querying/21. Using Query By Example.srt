1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
So let's take a quick look at an example of query by example.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So we're just going to go ahead and create our example object first.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
We'll create a user and we'll just do a new user.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
And then we'll populate this user with some data.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We're just going to set the name so we'll just do user.setName.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And we're actually going to set this to lower case Joe, and you'll see why in a minute here.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And then we're going to need to create this example object, we're just going to call it e.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And then we do example, dot, create, and then we pass in what we want to use as an example.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
So we're going to use user as an example.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Now we can actually change some things to this example. So I could do ignoreCase, for instance.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You can see all these different things like enableLike, so we could use the fields as if they were likes

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
So something similar to Joe would match.

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We can do ignoreCase, which we're going to add.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
We actually add all kinds of different things to this to make it so that we control how this example is matched.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
In our case, let's just do the simple case of ignoreCase.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
And then now we'll cerate our criteria.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We'll just do session.createCriteria and we're just going to do User.class.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And then we can do our .add here.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So if we do .add and add e it's going to add this example to our criteria.

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Now if we just run this you can see we get back one object, which is our Joe

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
and it matched even thought we had a lower case Joe

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
So we could also do anything else we want with this criteria.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We can add restrictions, we can set our projections, we can do anything else that we can do

24
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
because this is just a standard criteria.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
We could even add more examples if we wanted to build up some criteria.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now this is really useful because what this allows you to do

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is to simplify your code greatly when you're trying create some conditional matching.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
So if you can imagine if you had some kind of a screen where you could flip all kinds of options,

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
or maybe you had an advanced search in your application,

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
you could basically use that populate an object and then use that as an example.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then your criteria is automatically going to be created.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you think about writing the HQL to do that you'd have a lot of if statements,

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
and even if you tried to use the criteria API without the query by example,

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
then you would still have to write quite a bit of code.

35
00:02:31,000 --> 00:59:00,000
But here you can do something very simple, anytime you have an example object you can use that to do your query.
