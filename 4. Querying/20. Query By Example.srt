00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Query by example is a very powerful way to create Hibernate queries that requires very little code.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Using the criteria API we can create a set of criteria automatically from an instance of a java object

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
that's mapped as an entity in Hibernate.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
All we have to do is create an object and fill in the fields on that object

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
that we want to use as criteria that must be matched in our query.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Then we can create an example object from that object using the Hibernate API.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Finally we can pass that example to a criteria object and that criteria will be added to the criteria object.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Since we're using a regular criteria object here, we can add additional criteria

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:59:00,000
or do anything else we could do with a criteria object using this approach.
