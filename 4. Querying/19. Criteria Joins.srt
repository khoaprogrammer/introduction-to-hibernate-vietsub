1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So now's a good time to talk about joins with the criteria API.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
It doesn't quite work the same way that HQL does.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
So for example you might think that you might be able to do something like this.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
If we did a projection and then we said property

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:25,000
it seems like you should be able to do proteinData.total.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
After all, you could do that with HQL.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
But if we try to run this you'll notice that we get an error.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
And it basically can't resolve this proteinData.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
So the reason why it can't do this is because we actually have to manually specify the join,

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
and we do this with an alias.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
So we can say createAlias.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And then here we need to specify this proteinData property off of our user,

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
and then we're going to actually call this pd.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So now we can reference this with pd.total

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and we've told the criteria that it needs to include this table for this proteinData,

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
and it will allow us to query off of that.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So let's go ahead and run this now and you can see we get 50 and 20 because we're getting the pd.total.
