1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Now let's go ahead and move this criteria query into our main program.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I'm just going to go ahead and replace what we have here with this query.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With our createCriteria and we'll need a criteria object.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
And then we'll go ahead and comment out this query since we're not going to be using that.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We'll import our criteria.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And then we're going to call list on this, just like we did with the query.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
So we can do criteria.list.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:38,000
And right now this is set to UserTotal, we'll want to change this back to User.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And then let's just go ahead and print out the user names.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,000
And again, before I run this I'm going to exit out of eclipse and then restart eclipse

11
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
just to make sure that we font nave a problem since we were in this criteria editor.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It does tend to hang up that session.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So now let's go ahead now and run our application.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
And we can look at our console output and we can see that we get Joe, Bob, Amy.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So our criteria query is working.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
And you can see at this point that this isn't very verbose.

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It's basically just one call to create the criteria for a particular class.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
But you'll see, in a minute here, as we add some restrictions to this

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that this will get a little but more verbose than an actual HQL query does.
