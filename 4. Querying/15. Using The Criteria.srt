00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Let's test out the criteria API by using the criteria editor in our eclipse tools.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
So we're going to go to Hibernate perspective.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Then I'm going to go to this Hibernate tab.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
From here what, we can do is, we can do the same thing that we did before

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
so for example, if I want to query this user data, I can go to this Hibernate Criteria Editor

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and you can see by default it generate a criteria query.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
So the basic way that we create a criteria query

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
is that we use session.createCriteria and then we can pass the class

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
that we want to create a criteria query for.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
So in this case we're using User.class.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If I were to just run this, you can see that we get back all of the user objects.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We don't have any restrictions on here.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
This is the same thing as doing a select except that we're doing this in a more object oriented way.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Notice we don't have any string that contains a query; instead we're using a blank criteria for a user,

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
which is going to match everything.

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And unfortunately for the criteria editor, we can't see the SQL that's going to be generated.

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
If we go to this Hibernate Dynamic SQL Preview, you'll see that it says No HQL Query editor.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:59:00,000
So we can't actually see what's going to be generated. In this case, we have to actually run it to find out.
