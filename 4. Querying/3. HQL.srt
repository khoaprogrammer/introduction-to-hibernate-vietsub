00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hibernate query language or HQL is really easy to learn and understand if you're already familiar with SQL.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
HQL queries are written with a very similar syntax to regular SQL

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
except that they are operating against the java objects you have mapped instead of SQL tables directly.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
As you'll see when we talk about joins in HQL, this actually gives you some extra power

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
of being able to reference related entities in an HQL statement and not having to do an explicit join

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
like you would with a traditional SQL statement.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There is, however, a major weakness of HQL to be aware of.

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Just like it can be difficult to programmatically construct SQL statements,

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
it can be difficult to programmatically construct HQL statements.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
So you'll probably find HQL works best in situations where you'll have a mostly static query

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:59:00,000
that will differ in parameters passed to that query and not how it's constructed.
