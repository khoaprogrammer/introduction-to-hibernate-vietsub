1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So the first thing that we're going to do is to create some sample data to work with.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I went ahead an already created some sample data for us, I created this new method called PopulateSampleData.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
And we're going to go ahead and get rid of this other code that we had

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
since we're not going to be using this anymore.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
We're just going to, basically, populate some sample data and then we'll close our session factory.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
And if you look at this PopulateSampleData, all that I'm doing is I'm basically getting our session open,

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
beginning a transaction, and I'm creating three users: Joe, Bob, and Amy.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We're saving all those, committing that transaction.

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
And I created this very simple method to help us to create users quickly,

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
just so that we could add some test data.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It basically just creates a new user, adds some history to that user,

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and then also adds any alerts that we pass in.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So this will give us some basic data to get started with.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
We'll go ahead and run this against our database.

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And you can see that everything ran correctly. We did quite a few inserts and updates in there.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And now let's open up MySQL Workbench

17
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
and let's just take a quick look at this data that in the database.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
So if we refresh this, I went ahead and cleared out all of our old data,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
so we just have our tables that we created here.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
We're going to start with the users table.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If I look in here, you can see we have Job, Bob, and Amy.

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We have ID as 1, 2, and 3. Then they're associated with these PROTEIN_DATA_ID's

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We can follow this and look at the proteindata table

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and here we've got the protein data for each one of those users; the totals and the goals that I set.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And then we can take a look at the user goal alert in the goalalert, this is the mapping.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Remember that, when we look at our structure here, we don't have any reference from users

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
we're using this mapping table.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
So if we look at user_goalalert,

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we've got a user id that's mapped to a goal alert.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
So you can see, for example, USER_ID 1 has GOALALERT's 1 and 2. 2 has 3. 3 has 4.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
So if we look at goalalert, we can see here that we have 1 and 2 that went to our user 1, or Joe.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We've got 3 and 4 which correspond to the other users.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
So that gives us some data to work with.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We're going to be querying this data from this database now that we have a little bit more information

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:59:00,000
in our database than we did with our previous example.
