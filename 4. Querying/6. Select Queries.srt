1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Let's take a little bit of a closer look at our select statement.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
As I said before we don't actually need the select user part, we can take this out if we want to.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
You can leave it in if you think it's a little bit more clear.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I do prefer to leave it in in most cases.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
But we can just use from User, and we actually don't need this as.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What we're doing here with this user is we're basically aliasing this table so that we could use this later on.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Well the as is optional.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
But we also don't need this user because we're not actually using this anywhere else in the query.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So we could actual reduce our query to just from User.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
And you can see if I run this that we still get the same results.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Now let's go ahead and see how we would actually use this in a program.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So we're going to go to our application and let's go ahead and get a session.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
So after we populate the sample data we'll get our session.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
And we're going to do session.beginTransaction,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and then we're going to do this session.getTransaction at the end, and commit.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Now if you're just doing a query you really might not need a transaction,

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
we're just going to put everything in a transaction just to be safe, make sure no data's changing.

18
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's just a good habit to be in.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So then the next thing we're going to do is we're going to create our query.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
So we're going to use a query object, you'll need to import that.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We're going to call this Query, and we're going to basically just do a session.createQuery

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and then we put in our query. Which remember is just from User.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
That's going to give us our query.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
To execute our query, the easiest way is to just call list.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And this is going to return us a list of users.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
So we can make a list of user and then we can call this users.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Then we're going to set this equal to query.list.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And this is of course not going to return us back the typed list of users

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,000
so we're just going to assume that this is the list of users because we know that it will be.

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
And then we can loop through this.

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's just go ahead and loop, we're going to say user out of users.

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,000
And then in this loop let's just do a System.out.println and let's just print the name.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
We'll just do user.getName.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
So this will prove that we get our list of users. Then we're doing a commit on our transaction.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We want to close our Session Factory but we also want to close our session.

36
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
So we'll do session.close.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
So we'll go ahead and save this and let's give this a run.

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And one thing that you might see here, if you noticed that this hung for a little bit here,

39
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,000
is that you may need to go over to your Hibernate Configuration, here.

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
So remember we were in our HQL and we'd run this query.

41
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Well it tends to hang on a session and so if you have that problem

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
what you'll need to do is just to go over, here, and the if you right-click

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and then you just say either Close Configuration or you can do a Rebuild Configuration.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And what it will do is it will, basically, let go of that session that was open and then your code can execute.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
So now if we look at the results of this, you can see we have Joe, Bob, and Amy.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
So that's now we execute our query in Hibernate.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We basically just create our query with session.createQuery

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:59:00,000
and then we can execute it with list.
